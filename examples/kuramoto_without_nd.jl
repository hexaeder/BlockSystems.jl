## Network Dynamics without NetworkDynamics.jl
In this example we want to explore the same problem as in [Integration with `NetworkDynamics.jl`](@ref).
But this time without `NetworkDynamics.jl` ...

The goal is to generate IOBlocks for edges and vertices based on a given graph. In order to do so we have to make the vertex blocks a bit special: since MDK does not support vector inputs we need a special IOBlock for each Vertex depending on the outgoing and incoming edges as inputs.
=#
function gen_edge_block(name)
    @parameters t src(t) dst(t) K
    @variables o(t)
    IOBlock([ o ~ K*sin(src-dst) ], [src,dst], [o], name=Symbol(name))
end

function gen_vertex_block(n_in, n_out, name)
    @parameters t ω edgesum(t)
    @parameters in_edge[1:n_in](t)
    @parameters out_edge[1:n_out](t)
    @variables ϕ(t)
    D = Differential(t)

    rhs = ω
    if n_in > 0
        rhs += (+)(in_edge...)
    end
    if n_out > 0
        rhs -= (+)(out_edge...)
    end

    IOBlock([D(ϕ) ~ rhs],
            [in_edge..., out_edge...],
            [ϕ],
            name=Symbol(name))

The graph is defined as in the other example.

# First we generate a list of all edge-blocks because the don't depend on the vertices.

With the edges we can generate vert blocks based on their number of out and in edges.
We can also create the connections
```
v1.out_edge₁ => e1to2.src
v2.in_edge₁ => e1to2.dst
```
and so forth.

vert_blocks = IOBlock[]
connections = Pair[]

for i in vertices(g)
    out_edges = filter(e->e.src == i, edgelist)
    in_edges = filter(e->e.dst == i, edgelist)
    block = gen_vertex_block(length(in_edges), length(out_edges), "v$i")
    push!(vert_blocks, block)

        input = getproperty(block, Symbol("out_edge", Char(0x02080 + i)))

    end

    for (i, edge) in enumerate(in_edges)
        input = getproperty(block, Symbol("in_edge", Char(0x02080 + i)))
        push!(connections, input => edge.block.o)
    end
end

# Once the vertices are generated we can plug the edges src and dst to the output of the corresponding vertex.

We want the `connect_system` to get rid of the algebraic states for the edges. Therefore
we have to provide a list of `outputs` which only contains the outputs of the vertices. By doing
so the edge outputs will become `istates` of the `IOSystem` and upon connection might be reduced.
